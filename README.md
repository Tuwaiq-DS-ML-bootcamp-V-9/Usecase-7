# ðŸ“Œ The Football Players' Transfer Fee Prediction

## ðŸ“– Overview
The Football Players' Transfer Fee Prediction project uses a dataset containing information about football players, including their current value, position, age, and other related features. The goal is to predict the transfer fee for a player based on this data using machine learning algorithms. The project focuses on Linear Regression for predicting the transfer fee.
